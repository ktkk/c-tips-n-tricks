Feel free to open pull requests with more useful C tricks or snippets.

Please stick to standard C (eg. no GCC specific attributes) as much as possible, unless it directly relates to a useful tip/trick.

## Code format

- Tabs > Spaces
- Macros are capitalized
- Enums are capitalized
- Pointer declarations have the * after the type, not before the variable name
- Functions/structs/enums/unions have their opening curly brace inline with the signature
